# Portolan agent norms

All agents MUST read this document before starting work, with no exceptions, ever. (Claude Code does not read `AGENTS.md` but imports this file via a one-line `CLAUDE.md`.) Most of this content is synced downstream from `portolan-ops`. Put repo-specific instructions in `AGENTS.md`, never in `CLAUDE.md`, which the sync overwrites.

## Ground rules

Agents MUST read the complete contents of [norms](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-ops/blob/main/norms) and [policies](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-ops/blob/main/policies/) before starting work, with no exceptions, ever.

The [portolan-spec](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-spec) repo is the absolute ground truth for the Portolan spec. All other tools are downstream of it.

Before documenting any command, flag, or API, verify that it exists.

Use conventional commits always.

All tickets and PRs MUST follow the [templates](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-ops/blob/main/templates/).

## Org-wide facts

The canonical homepage is https://www.portolan-sdi.org/. Canonical URLs live in [copy/urls.md](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-ops/blob/main/copy/urls.md). Do not hardcode variants.

Community discussion happens in the [Portolan Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/portolan) and the [Portolan channel](https://cloudnativegeo.slack.com/archives/C0A1JBH9529) in Cloud-Native Geo Slack. Planning happens in [org-level GitHub projects](https://github.com/orgs/portolan-sdi/projects/1).

Files between `ops-sync` markers are synced from [portolan-ops](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-ops). They are overwritten on every sync run. To change one, edit it in portolan-ops.

One canonical home per fact. If a value like a color, URL, or policy line exists in portolan-ops, link to it rather than copying it.

## This Repository

A template for a git-backed Portolan catalog. Repositories created from it
inherit everything here, so a mistake in this file propagates.

### The publish boundary

`catalog/` is the published catalog. Everything in it is published, and
nothing outside it ever is. Do not move a file into `catalog/` to make it
publish, and do not add a path outside `publish_dir` to `tools/publish.py`.
The boundary is the only thing standing between a scratch file and a public
bucket, and it holds because it is structural rather than a list of
exclusions.

### Data never enters git

Never commit a GeoParquet, COG, PMTiles, Zarr, or COPC file. If a gate needs
bytes to check, generate them in CI. Git keeps every version of a binary
forever and deleting it later reclaims nothing.

### The conformance allow-list

`ACCEPTED` in `tests/test_conformance.py` ships empty. Never add an entry
without a matching row in `docs/conformance.md` giving the rule, where it
fires, why it is accepted, and the issue tracking its removal.

### Published agent guides

Every claim in a `catalog/**/AGENTS.md` is either quoted from a source or
measured from the data. An invented join key or column name produces a
confident wrong answer that nothing downstream catches.

### The links back to this repository

`catalog/catalog.json` ships a `vcs` link and an `issues` link. Both hrefs are
setup placeholders, so `tests/test_setup.py` catches a half-edited repository.
The Portolan spec recommends these two links for a git-backed catalog. See
[git-backed catalogs](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-spec/blob/main/specs/best-practices/git-backed-catalogs.md),
which merged in August 2026.

Keep both hrefs absolute. The repository sits outside the published catalog,
so a relative href resolves against the public base URL. Each placeholder
holds a `://`, because `tests/test_links.py` treats an href without one as a
path and looks for it on disk.
